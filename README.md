# nasm-education
Going through some nasm tutorials and doing examples

Right now, the tutorial I am running through is located at:
https://asmtutor.com/

and it is pretty decent. Goes at a rather slow pace--but considering
how long it took me to realise I was mixing up jz and jmp... that is 
prolly a good thing for that one.
